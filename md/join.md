#### Summer Running

PLEASE plan to run with us in May and the summer!

Cross Country will officially begin in August, but summer running with us is HIGHLY recommended.  Runners will have a 5K time trail to be able to assess the current ability of each athlete.  Summer running is highly recommended.  Please find suggested running schedules below.  New runners may want to contact Coach Lindler to be put in touch with the team captains.  **We will post summer conditioning times on our live calendar**  All athletes are HIGHLY encouraged to run with others per the recommended schedule.  Please remember to eat well, rest appropriately, and stay well hydrated.  You should never run without eating first, with plenty of time for the food to digest.  Runners should always make sure a responsible party knows where and when they are running for safety reasons.

If you follow the suggested schedule, it is recommended that if you miss a day, you just skip that day and maintain the schedule.  Do not try to do “catch up” mileage.  Consistency is the key to success.  Please note there are scheduled rest days - these are designed for REST!  Allow your body to heal and recover from the rigors of summer running.  Late in the season when two-a-day runs are scheduled, be very mindful of the heat.  Please make sure you have proper nutrition and hydration to sustain the runs.  Do not try to overrun your body’s ability.  Good shoes are a must!

The work you put in in the summer will help ensure a successful fall.  If you are willing to do the work this summer, good things will happen in the fall.  Remember there is a time trial on the first day of practice.

Please see the Misc link above for detailed summer running plans.
