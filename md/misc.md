//#### XTerra 5K

//Again this year, our team is helping with the Xterra Half Marathon at Harbison State Forest on Sunday, July 8^th^. There is a 5K our athletes can run for free at 7:10 AM. Although this 5K is not a team sanctioned event nor in any way required, its a great opportunity for our runners to get a feel for where they are conditioning-wise. There are actually two races happening that Sunday, the Xterra Harbison Half Marathon, and the 5K. They have made a special offer to our runners - if they are willing to stay after the 5K until about 11:30 and help with the half - marathon, they can enter for free! Otherwise, if they just want to run the 5K they will have to pay the registration fee. Helping with the half marathon would involve staffing water stations, helping at the finish line, etc. The half marathon starts at 7 am, 10 minutes before the 5K starts.

//If your athlete would like to run the 5K for free and help with the half marathon, please visit the website link below, click on the link for the online registration, complete the registration accurately, and enter the promo code your captains have given you to waive the registration fee. Remember, its free only if you can stay and help the entire time. Be sure and let your captains know that you have registered and are planning on helping by July 3rd.

//We could also use people to help that are not running the 5K, so please consider helping out. Any questions about the Harbison Forest run
//ask Coach Saxby or one of the captains.  Athletes planning on running the 5K should plan on being at the race around 6:15 for proper warm up. -->
